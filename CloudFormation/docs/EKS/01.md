1. Amazon EKS runs a single tenant Kubernetes control plane for each cluster, and control plane infrastructure is not shared across clusters or AWS accounts.

2. This control plane consists of at least two API server nodes and three etcd nodes that run across three Availability Zones within a Region. 

3. Amazon EKS uses Amazon VPC network policies to restrict traffic between control plane components to within a single cluster. Control plane components for a cluster cannot view or receive communication from other clusters or other AWS accounts, except as authorized with Kubernetes RBAC policies.

4. You can also deploy applications to AWS Fargate if you don't need to manage nodes.
